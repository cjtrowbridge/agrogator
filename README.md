# agrogator
This simple, free script helps aggregate rss feeds in-browser using Google's free Feeds API and JQuery. It can be added to any page or launched from the desktop and styled however you would like :]

To change, add or remove feeds, simply add another object with class "agrogator_enclosure" and a data-uri pointing to the rss feed you want to add.

All specified feeds are fetched, up to the maximum number of entries set in the included script, and then added to the container and sorted by pubdate.
